Power Options

Sleep mode is when the computer turns off all the unneeded functions and leaves any open programs or apps run in RAM.
Hibernate mode just save all open apps or programs to an internal hard drive before shutting down.
Restart made keeps everything you have open but it restarts the computer so you may lose any unsaved progress.
